üí° While Java-based web applications were once popular, the emergence of JEE and Spring Boot have made them somewhat obsolete in the current era. JEE provides a powerful framework that enables developers to build large, complex applications with ease, while Spring Boot simplifies the process of building web applications by reducing boilerplate code and providing a range of pre-built components. In addition, JEE and Spring Boot offer a wide range of features, including security, performance, and scalability, that are essential for building modern web applications. Therefore, while Java-based web applications are still in use, many developers are now turning to JEE and Spring Boot for their web development needs due to their numerous advantages and superior capabilities.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, both JEE and Spring Boot are powerful frameworks for developing web applications. JEE is a more traditional approach, providing a full stack of technologies for enterprise-level web applications. Spring Boot, on the other hand, is a more lightweight and flexible framework that emphasizes simplicity and convention over configuration.

Both frameworks have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice ultimately depends on the needs and requirements of the project. JEE is a great choice for large and complex applications that require a robust set of technologies and tools, while Spring Boot is ideal for smaller and simpler applications that can benefit from faster development and deployment times.

The architecture of a web application using JEE or Spring Boot will depend on the specific needs of the project, but both frameworks provide a wide range of options for building and deploying applications. In general, JEE applications are built using a layered architecture, where the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer are separated. Spring Boot, on the other hand, promotes a more modular architecture, where different components can be easily added or removed as needed.

Overall, both JEE and Spring Boot are great options for developing web applications, and the choice between the two will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the project. It's important to carefully evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each framework and choose the one that best meets the needs of the application being developed.
